## Info 

**Lynx Shells** is a set of housing/apartment shells for your FiveM server. There is 3 different shells to choose from that come furnished and unfurnished (6 total)

I made these a while ago but haven’t used them and my current project doesn’t need them so thought I’d put them up for others to use if they wish.

**Remove the Ymap folder if you use your own method of spawning in the shells**
